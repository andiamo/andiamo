## Syphon + MIDI version

This version of Andiamo has modifications so it can be driven with MIDI controller such as the [Korg nanoKontrol](http://www.korg.com/us/products/controllers/nanokontrol2/), and directs its output
through [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) for integration with other realt-time performance tools, like [VDMX](http://vdmx.vidvox.net/).

It requires the following:

* [Processing 3.0.x](https://processing.org/download/?processing)
* [Syphon library](https://github.com/Syphon/Processing)
* [MidiBus library](http://www.smallbutdigital.com/themidibus.php)

The libraries can be installed through the Contribution Manager in Processing.

It has been tested only with the first nanoKontrol device, and the MIDI mappings hard-coded in andiamo might not work with other devices.
